# SESSION_LOG

## 2026-07-12 — Share recalculation, Firestore rules security, indexes, governance — APK v1.5.1+59

- Scope: Remaining audit findings from Master Audit Report v12 implemented in one session
- Changes implemented:
  - **Share auto-recalculation** (`job_repository.dart`): `adminUpdateJob()` now proportionally recalculates `techSplitShare`, `techWindowShare`, `techFreestandingShare`, `techUninstallSplitShare`, `techUninstallWindowShare`, `techUninstallFreestandingShare`, `techBracketShare`, and `charges.deliveryAmount` on every sibling doc when admin changes shared invoice totals. Uses integer `~/` division for unit counts and floating-point ratio for delivery. Computes adjustments inside the `if (aggregateSnap.exists)` block where old totals are available; applies them in the fan-out loop via `siblingShareAdjustments` map.
  - **Firestore rules security fixes**:
    - F-C002: `adminGeneralJobUpdateAllowed()` now enforces `request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly([...])` — 35-field allow-list prevents admin from touching immutable fields (techId, submittedAt, isDeleted, settlement*) on non-approved jobs
    - F-C014: `validJobCreatePayload()` — added `invoiceNumber.size() <= 50`
    - F-C008: `validJobCreatePayload()` — added `clientName.size() <= 200` and `get('clientContact', '').size() <= 50`
  - **Firestore indexes** (`firestore.indexes.json`): Added `jobs [techId + isDeleted + date DESC]`, `jobs [status + isDeleted + date DESC]`, `ac_installs [techId + status + date DESC]`, `earnings [techId + status + date DESC]`
  - **Governance**: bumped pubspec to `1.5.1+59`; updated `MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md` version; added `analyze_out.txt` to `.gitignore`; added CHANGELOG entries for 1.5.0+58 and 1.5.1+59
- Verification:
  - `flutter analyze --no-pub` — "No issues found!"
  - `flutter test` — all tests passed
  - Firestore rules linted and deployed
  - Firestore indexes deployed
  - APK v1.5.1+59 built and installed on R5GL22RGT9V

## 2026-05-08 — Bug fixes: shared install editability, history tab colors; feature: admin shared installs list — APK v1.4.9+54

- Scope: Two bug fixes + one new feature; split-per-abi APK built and installed on R5GL22RGT9V
- Changes implemented:
  - **Shared install editability fix** (`approvals_screen.dart`): Approved shared install tiles now navigate via `context.push('/admin/job/${job.id}', extra: job)` instead of opening a read-only `_showJobVerificationDialog`. The admin edit button on `JobDetailsScreen` (visible when approved + unpaid + admin) is now reachable. Removed unused `approvedGroupSize` local variable.
  - **History tab color fix** (`job_history_screen.dart`): Added explicit `labelColor: ArcticTheme.arcticBlue` and `unselectedLabelColor: ArcticTheme.arcticTextPrimary` to the `TabBar` so Jobs and In/Out labels are clearly visible against the dark AppBar background.
  - **Admin shared installs stats card** (`admin_dashboard_screen.dart`): Added `approvedShared = ref.watch(approvedSharedInstallsProvider)` and a `_DashCard` showing approved shared install count after the AC-type row. Card is non-tappable when count is 0; navigates to `/admin/jobs/shared` when count > 0.
  - **AdminSharedInstallsScreen** (new file `admin_shared_installs_screen.dart`): `ConsumerWidget` watching `approvedSharedInstallsProvider`; shows list of approved shared install jobs with client name, tech/invoice, date, status badge, and shared-install chip. Tap → `context.push('/admin/job/:jobId')`.
  - **Route** (`app_router.dart`): Added `/admin/jobs/shared` GoRoute before the existing `/admin/job/:jobId` route.
- Verification:
  - `flutter analyze --no-pub` — "No issues found!"
  - `flutter build apk --split-per-abi --release` — arm64-v8a installed on R5GL22RGT9V
  - APK v1.4.9+54 uninstalled old + installed new; APK copied to /sdcard/Download/
- No Firestore rules/indexes changed → no deploy needed

## 2026-07-11 — Admin edit approved jobs, silent error fixes, audit remediations — APK v1.4.8+52

- Scope: Completed pending infrastructure items from prior session; implemented admin edit of approved jobs feature; fixed all 12 silent error handlers; Firestore index + rules deploy; full sign-off
- Changes implemented:
  - **Admin edit approved jobs** (full feature):
    - `firestore.rules`: `adminApprovedJobUpdate()` helper; `jobUpdateAllowed()` updated to permit admin edits of approved/unpaid jobs
    - `JobModel`: `adminEditedBy: String?` + `adminEditedAt: DateTime?` fields; freezed + json codegen run
    - `JobRepository.adminUpdateJob(JobModel job, String adminUid)`: updates approved job with admin metadata
    - `SubmitJobScreen`: admin early-return branch calls `adminUpdateJob()` + `context.pop()` when `_isEditing && user.isAdmin`
    - `JobDetailsScreen`: admin edit button (visible when approved + unpaid + admin); admin-edited badge (when `adminEditedAt != null`)
    - ARB: 4 new l10n keys — `tryAgain`, `adminEditJob`, `adminEditedBadge`, `adminEditedAt`; `flutter gen-l10n` run
  - **U-01..U-12 silent errors fixed**: All 12 `SizedBox.shrink()` error handlers replaced with `ErrorCard(exception: ...)` across `AdminDashboardScreen`, `TechDashboardScreen`, `HistoricalImportScreen`, `TeamScreen`, `InvoiceReconciliationScreen`
  - **L-01 l10n fix**: `ErrorCard` "Try Again" hardcoded string replaced with `context.l10n.tryAgain`
  - **N-01 nav fix**: `context.go('/admin/team')` → `context.push('/admin/team')` in `AdminDashboardScreen`
  - **S-01 isAdmin guard**: `pendingCollaborationAggregatesProvider` now returns empty list for non-admin users
  - **D-01/D-02 Firestore indexes**: Composite indexes for `expenses` (techId + status + date) and `earnings` (techId + status + date) added to `firestore.indexes.json` and deployed
  - **Test fix**: `stale_shared_aggregates_test.dart` — seed dates changed from 10 days to 31 days so they exceed the 30-day default threshold
- Verification:
  - `flutter analyze --no-pub` — "No issues found!"
  - `flutter test` — 423/423 passed
  - `flutter build apk --split-per-abi --release` — arm64 30.3MB, armeabi 28.8MB, x86_64 31.8MB
  - APK v1.4.8+52 uninstalled old + installed new on R5GL22RGT9V
  - Firestore rules + indexes deployed to actechs-d415e
- Git: commit `9664949` pushed to main (pre-commit hook auto-bumped to 1.4.9+53 for next build)

## 2026-07-11 — Bug fixes: tech data loading, WhatsApp icon, duplicate email detection — APK v1.4.5+49

- Scope: Four regressions diagnosed and fixed; APK built and installed on device R5GL22RGT9V
- Changes implemented:
  - **Tech dashboard + history data loading fix**: `technicianJobs()` and `pendingApprovals()` in `job_repository.dart` had `.where('isDeleted', isNotEqualTo: true)` combined with `.orderBy('submittedAt', ...)`, requiring a missing composite Firestore index. Fix: removed `isDeleted` from Firestore query; moved filter to Dart `.map()` stage (`.where((job) => !job.isDeleted)`). No index deploy needed.
  - **WhatsApp icon fix** (`team_screen.dart`): Changed generic `Icon(Icons.chat_rounded)` → `const FaIcon(FontAwesomeIcons.whatsapp, size: 20)` with `font_awesome_flutter` import.
  - **Duplicate email foolproofing**: Added `hardDeleteUser(uid)` to `UserRepository` (guards active users), `duplicateEmailUsersProvider` (derived from `allUsersProvider`, zero extra listeners) to `admin_providers.dart`, and `_DuplicateEmailBanner` + `_handlePurgeEmailDuplicate()` to `TeamScreen` — shows warning card with Remove button when inactive duplicate email users exist.
  - **ARB localization**: Added 4 new keys (`duplicateEmailWarningTitle`, `duplicateEmailWarningBody`, `removeDuplicateUser`, `userPermanentlyDeleted`) to all 3 locale files; fixed missing ICU `}` in Arabic plural expression.
- Verification:
  - `flutter gen-l10n` — success
  - `flutter analyze --no-pub` — "No issues found!"
  - `flutter build apk --release` — Built (74.8MB, 234s)
  - APK `1.4.5+49` uninstalled old + installed new on R5GL22RGT9V
- No Firestore rules/indexes changed → no deploy needed
